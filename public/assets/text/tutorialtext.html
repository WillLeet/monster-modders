    <h3>Sandbox</h3>
    <p>
        This mode is for testing out the game features. In this single-player mode, you can add and remove platforms as you'd like as well as move around to test 
        out the game. You may also find it adventageous to devise a plan on where to place your platforms to best find your way to the finish in mulitplayer 
        mode!

    <h3>Multiplayer</h3>
    <p>
        The best part of this game! In here, you will want to first select a room for you and other player's to join. A room can have anywhere between 2-4
        players to get the game started. Once all players are ready, the game will commence when someone presses the button in the top left of the screen.
        At this point the 'Build Phase' starts. You will have 15 seconds to place and remove platforms at will to find a path to the finish. Once that
        timer concludes, it is a mad dash to the finish! The player who reaches the finish first is crowned the winner. If the timer runs out before anyone
        reaches the finish, the game will conclude with no winner :(

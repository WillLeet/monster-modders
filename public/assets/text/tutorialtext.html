    <h3>Placing and Deleting Platforms</h3>
    <h4>To place a platform you can either:</h4>
    <p>
	    1.'Click and drag' the 'Add Platform' button to move a platform to your desired location <br>
	    2. Click the 'Add Platform' button which will have a platform appear and then 'click and drag' the platform to move it to your desired location <br>
    </p>
    <h4>To delete a platform:</h4>
    <p>
        Click the 'Remove Platform' button and then click the platform you would like to remove
    </p>

    <h3>Sandbox</h3>
    <p>
        This mode is for testing out the game features. In this single-player mode, you can add and remove platforms as you'd like as well as move around to test 
        out the game. Unlike in Multiplayer mode, you can drag around already placed platforms here! Use this mode to hone your building and platforming skills.
    </p>

    <h3>Multiplayer</h3>
    <p>
        The best part of this game! To start a multiplayer game, enter any open room and hit the button in the top left of the screen when all players are ready.
        At the start of each round, you will have 15 seconds to place and remove platforms at will to find a path to the finish. But choose wisely as you only have 5 actions per build phase! 
        Once that timer concludes, it is a mad dash to the finish! Each round players will be awarded points determined by which place they finish in. If the timer concludes and you do not reach the finish for 
        that round, no points will be awarded :(
